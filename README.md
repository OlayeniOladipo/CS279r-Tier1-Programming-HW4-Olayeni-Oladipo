**Reflection:** What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?


**Important files to view:** 
- src/lib/header/Header.svelte
- src/app.css and src/app.html
- src/routes/+layout.svelte
- src/routes/todos folder entirely

**Instructions** to launch prototype:

1) Clone or download this repo, saving the files to a directory
2) Open terminal and CD into the directory of the downloaded files.
3) Enter the following line into your terminal (If it doesn't work enter this line first then try again: npm i):
> npm run dev
4) Open the link (similar to localhost:5173) that pops up in your terminal
5) Press the TODOS tab at the top of web browser.

On the link, play around with the following features: <br />
1) Add a to-do list item by pressing where it says "+ tap to add a todo" and typing in a task and pressing your enter key.
2) Check off the to-do list item by pressing the todo circle to the left of the item.
3) Edit the text of the todo item by pressing the text, then editing 
3) Press the trash icon to delete thetodo item.
